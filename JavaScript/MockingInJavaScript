Reasons for mocking:

1. To remove dependency on the frame object.
2. To still allow testing of the behaviour of the game object

Ways to mock:

1. Pass in the frame function into the game function as a new spy
  - Allows the game object to create a mock frame in test scenarios
2. Spy on an existing frame object

jasmine.createSpy("getName() spy")
jasmine.createSpy("getName() spy").and

expect(testPerson.getName).toHaveBeenCalled();

How to mock in bowling

1. When creating the game, pass in the Frame function
2. Call the passed in frame function when creating a new frame



NOTES:

Current rules:

1. If first frame, create new frame
2. If the previous frame is not complete, add to frame (send in frame - could we send in frame number instead?)
3. If the previous frame is complete, create new frame
4. If game is complete, don't do anything

New rules:
1. If the game is not complete, continue
2. If it's the first frame or if the previous frame is complete, create new frame
3. Else (the game is incomplete, the previous frame is incomplete, it must be time to add to frame) add to frame
extra - if adding to frame, pass in the frame number. Inside "add to frame"
  check to see if frame has been passed in and if not, create new frame

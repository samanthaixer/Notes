# Makers Academy - March 2019 Cohort

4th March until end of May 2019

## Week by week reflections and learnings

### Week 1

#### Key learnings

- Debugging - how to follow a process to quickly and simply find the cause of a problem. Isolating the problematic line of code to a single line of code before making a change.
- Pairing - how to work in a pair, approaches to sharing the keyboard, giving feedback after each session, checking in before a session
- TDD
- OOP

#### Reflections

This week seemed exhausting but reflecting on it just over a week later, it seemed fairly simple. No big topics to consume, just learning some approaches and good practices.

### Week 2

#### Key learnings

- Dependency injection and using doubles and mocks - how to test classes in isolation
- Domain modelling - specifically using sequence diagrams and class diagrams to show how classes relate to each other

#### Reflections

This week seemed full of concepts that I felt I was slow to pick up. However after a few lightbulb moments I suddenly felt like I understood dependency injection (to a point) and was able to write tests using Doubles. Injecting classes needs more practice but injecting objects and mocking methods is going well.
During the weekend challenge, which took up way more of my personal time than I was really happy with, I discovered that having a sequence diagram really helped me to see where I needed dependency injection and mocks.

### Week 3

#### Key learnings

- How the web hangs together - that a server in client-server is not the machine but the software running.
- GET and POST messages - that when a page receives HTML back with more links, it sends further calls to get the rest of the content
- That JavaScript is the only client-side programming language. You can write a website in other languages but it is translated into JavaScript
- That you can use a command such as `save_and_open_page` in a tool that is simulating using a webpage to actually open what is happening at that moment

#### Reflections

This week has been really exciting as you can see your code coming together in a user interface. The debugging has gotten more complex as we try to navigate our way through routes and files but it's starting to feel a bit more real and a bit more useful.
The afternoon exercise this week is to create a game as a web app. If you look at the exercise as a whole it seems completely overwhelming with a feeling of "I could never build that". However, if you break it down and tackle it user story by user story you can quickly build up functionality without worrying too much what it looks like.

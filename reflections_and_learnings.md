# Makers Academy - March 2019 Cohort

4th March until end of May 2019

## Week by week reflections and learnings

### Week 1

#### Key learnings

- Debugging - how to follow a process to quickly and simply find the cause of a problem. Isolating the problematic line of code to a single line of code before making a change.
- Pairing - how to work in a pair, approaches to sharing the keyboard, giving feedback after each session, checking in before a session
- TDD
- OOP

#### Reflections

This week seemed exhausting but reflecting on it just over a week later, it seemed fairly simple. No big topics to consume, just learning some approaches and good practices.

### Week 2

#### Key learnings

- Dependency injection and using doubles and mocks - how to test classes in isolation
- Domain modelling - specifically using sequence diagrams and class diagrams to show how classes relate to each other

#### Reflections

This week seemed full of concepts that I felt I was slow to pick up. However after a few lightbulb moments I suddenly felt like I understood dependency injection (to a point) and was able to write tests using Doubles. Injecting classes needs more practice but injecting objects and mocking methods is going well.
During the weekend challenge, which took up way more of my personal time than I was really happy with, I discovered that having a sequence diagram really helped me to see where I needed dependency injection and mocks.

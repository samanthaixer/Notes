My goals

- Understand some more about JavaScript as language - prototype-based rather than classical OOP
- Investigate and understand the Count project - this apparently shows the full stack using JavaScript and AJAX
- Understand different approaches to learning a new language
- Create a list of things that I feel I need to spend more time on
- Start to think about my portfolio



## Course goals

- Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
- Follow an effective process for learning a new language

By the end of the week, the goal is to be able to answer "yes" to the week's primary question:

- Can you learn a new language and its patterns?

### Check your understanding

To guide your learning, aim to be able to answer "yes" to the questions below.

#### JavaScript

- Can you read and write JavaScript syntax?

- Can you understand the rules that govern the behaviour of the `this` keyword?

- Can you follow the flow of an Ajax request and response?

- Can you follow the flow of control through code that uses callbacks?

#### Transferring your existing skills

- Can you encapsulate behaviour in JavaScript?

- Can you get visibility effectively in JavaScript?

- Can you TDD in JavaScript?

- Can you follow the flow of control over the whole web app cycle? e.g. the interface of a thermostat is displayed in HTML/CSS, the "increase temperature" button is clicked, a JavaScript click event fires, JavaScript code runs to handle the event, an Ajax request is made, a Sinatra controller POST action handler is run, a Thermostat Ruby model is updated, the new temperature is saved to a Postgres database, the new temperature is returned as JSON by the Ruby controller, JavaScript code runs to update the temperature in the web page.

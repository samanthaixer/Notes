# Week 1
By the end of the week all developers can:

- Test-drive a simple program using objects and methods
- Pair using the driver-navigator style
- Follow an effective debugging process
- Describe some basic OO principles like encapsulation, SRP

### challenges
*Boris bikes*
*Airport*

# Week 2
By the end of the week all developers can:

- Use all of week 1's skills (don't underestimate the importance of this)
- Break one class into two classes that work together, while maintaining test coverage
- Unit test classes in isolation using mocking
- Explain some basic OO principles and tie them to high level concerns (e.g. ease of change)
- Review another person's code and give them meaningful feedback

### challenges

*Oystercard*
*Takeaway*

# Week 3
By the end of the week all developers can:

- Build a simple web app
- Follow an effective debugging process for web applications
- Explain the basics of how the web works (e.g. request/response, HTTP, HTML, CSS)
- Explain the MVC pattern

### challenges

*Battle*
*Rock, paper, scissors*

# Week 4
By the end of the week all developers can:

- Build a simple web app with a database
- Follow an effective debugging process for database applications
- Explain the basics of how databases work (e.g. tables, SQL, basic relationships)

### challenges

*Bookmark manager*
*Chitter*

# Week 5
By the end of the week all developers can:

- Test drive a simple front-end web app with Javascript
- Follow an effective process for learning a new language

### challenges

*Thermostat*
*Bowling*

# Week 6
By the end of the week all developers can build tested, easy-to-change software in a team using these processes:

- Break down projects into tasks and allocate them to pairs
- Build to a specificiation (rather than challenges)
- Run stand-ups and retrospectives
- Use a branch/PR/merge git workflow
- Give and receive meaningful code review

### challenges

*Makers BnB (in groups)*
*Bowling again*

# Week 7

By the end of the week all developers can:

- Build a front-end app in Javascript
- Work competently in Javascript (This week is analogous to week 2 in that developers will be wrestling with some underlying language concepts that are not well understood (by Makers).)
- Reason about asynchronous behaviour in Javascript

Most of the work and interventions we have run historically are meant to 'de-magic' Javascript and force developers to confront the pieces they are glossing over in an attempt to get work done.

### challenges

*Notes App*
*Newspaper API integration*

# Weeks 8 and 9
Acebook (group project)

# Week 10
Tech tests (quality?)

*bank*
*gilded rose*

# Weeks 11 and 12
Final project

# Including empathy

## What is empathy?

- Trying to put yourself in someone else's shoes
- Trying to understand how they might be feeling or what they might be thinking

** NOTE ** you are not responsible for other people's feelings

Reiterate the 3 ways to understand your profile:
baseline happiness, how wide is your swing, recovery time

Reiterate "I feel how I feel and that's OK", "breathe" and "go into your body"

Active listening - be in the moment, guide your thoughts back to listening if they stray away or start to think about solutions. Assume you're going to be tested on what they say - helps with concentration

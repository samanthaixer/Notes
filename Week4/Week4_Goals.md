# Week 4 personal goals
- Refactor the rps challenge to use a simpler hash - DONE
- Be more present - less going on at home, get my head into the week
- Look at the rps challenge re how we create the game - Singleton pattern? Class methods?
- Focus on database modelling
- Look at more complicated SQL queries e.g. joins
- Understand more about RESTful
- Understand more about password security

# Detailed objectives

Agile & TDD

- ❤️  Generate User Stories from Requirements **OK**
 - Turn "users got to log in" into "As a user, so that I can access my stuff, I want to log in".
- ❤️  Build a complete full-stack feature. **OK**
 - Write a feature test for viewing bookmarks. Build the feature, including controller, model, and database code.
Engineering and 'Dev Recipes'

- ❤️  Set up a Ruby web project. **OK**
 - Take an empty directory. Get Sinatra up and running and showing "Hello World" when I visit localhost.
- ❤️  Attach a database to a web application. **OK**
 - Use SQL in a controller to read a bookmark record from a database.
- ❤️  Separate application behaviour from database behaviour.
 - Write a controller method that gets all bookmarks from a database and renders them into a view. **OK**
- ❤️  Map objects across systems. **OK**
 - Explain how a Bookmark instance and a bookmark database record are related to one another.
- 💛  Create a CRUD system.
 - Create, Read, Update, and Delete bookmark records in a database from a user-clickable web interface.
- 💛  Implement a RESTful routing convention.
 - Turn routes like this: GET /show-bookmark-1 into routes like this: GET /bookmarks/1.
- 💚  Wrap an adapter object.
 - Call Bookmark.create and get back an instance of the Bookmark class with all the attributes you passed to .create, and an id attribute.
- 💚  Validate in the model layer.
 - Stop Bookmark.create from creating a bookmark record in the database if its URL is invalid.
- 💚  Build a Registration system.
 - Allow a user to sign up to an application through a clickable form. Also, encrypt their password.
- 💚  Build an Authentication system.
 - Allow a user to sign in to an application through a clickable form, using some details including their password.


Databases

- ❤️  Install PostgreSQL.
 - Make it so that when you type psql into your Terminal, you get an interface to PostgreSQL.
- ❤️  Create a database.
 - Make it so that when you list databases (\l) in psql, you can see a database you created in the list of databases.
- ❤️  Implement a one-to-many relationship.
 - Get all comments for a bookmark using SQL, or with a method like this: bookmark.comments.
- 💛  Use the psql command to interact with PostgreSQL.
 - Create a database in psql. Add a table. Add some records. Read those records.
- 💛  Create tables using SQL.
 - Make it so that when you list a table (\dt) in psql, you see a table you created.
- 💛  Use SQL query terms like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, *.
 - Use psql to read all bookmarks, then just bookmarks with https URLs, from a database.
- 💛  Use SQL CRUD terms like INSERT, DELETE, and UPDATE.
 - Use psql to create a new bookmark in a database. Then update its URL. Then delete it.
- 💛  Implement a many-to-many relationship.
 - Get all tags for a bookmark using SQL, and all bookmarks for a tag using SQL, or with methods like this: bookmark.tags and tag.bookmarks.


Tooling

- 💛  Set up a test environment.
 - When you run your tests, your application only writes and reads data from a 'test database'. The test database is emptied between tests.
- 💚  Use database GUIs to interact with databases.
 - Use TablePlus to read and write from and to your database.
- 💚  Use Rake to automate environment tasks.
 - Take a script you run from the command-line like this: ruby my_automation_script.rb and make it work when you do this: rake script:automate.


Skills

- 💛  Test-Drive advanced Objects in Ruby, including adapter, wrapper, and service objects.
 - Write a test for a Bookmark.create method that takes properties as arguments, and gives you back an object which exposes all those properties as attributes, and has an id attribute.
- ❤️  Use a step-by-step approach to pull out logic from concretes to abstractions.
 - Take a line of SQL written in a controller that reads bookmarks from the database. Encapsulate it in a method on a Bookmark model.
